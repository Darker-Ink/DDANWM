# DarkerInks Discord API & Websocket Mocker

DarkerInks Discord API & Websocket Mocker (or DDANWM for short) is a simple Discord API and WS mocker for testing bots and more.

DDANWM plans to be a simple way to test your bot for production or just to test your bot in general. With simple functions to create and dispatch events, you can test your bot in no time.

DDANWM It requires no database; everything is stored in memory, making it easy to use and setup.

## Notes

- DDANWM is still in development, so expect bugs and more.
- DDANWM is NOT for having a "custom discord instance" or "self-hosted discord", it's for testing bots, do not try to use it for that it will not work.
- This project takes GREAT inspiration from [wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk)!
